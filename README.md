# AstroED - ASTROphotos EDitor
## inspired by siril and many others windows software

This will be program to stuck astropictures for Linux, user friendly.
For now it will be based on siril (http://free-astro.org/index.php/Siril).

Currently program is at very early developing stage.

Implemented:
* video parser - if program meets video files it automatically lists all frames inside like it is folder with files (virtual filesystem in fact)
* lua editor - made LUA text editor with autocomplete, highlights, indents.
* zoomable preview of original image
* EXIF reading from JPEGS


TODO / Ideas:
* lua project - everything user do must be logged and saved as LUA code. And can be "replayed" using this code.
